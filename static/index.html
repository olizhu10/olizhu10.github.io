                    I worked alongside a data engineering team in an agile environment, improving my database skills and knowledge.
                    Throughout the summer, I produced a proof of concept for reimplementing a legacy system with new technology and making it cloud-compatible.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    My goal was to prove that a current in-house built data reporting tool could be replaced by Microsoft Power BI. In doing this, I developed data modeling skills, used database and data analysis technologies such as DBArtisan, SQL, and OLAP cubes, and enhanced my knowledge of cloud technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Execution of this proof of concept would increase team efficiency by reducing support costs and allow for greater flexibility in data visualization for business users.

                  <p class="card-text">I worked on the Payments Fleet, developing a REST API using Java, Gradle, and Spring Framework.
                    The API was used to create a direct connection to a vendor service, bypassing a large external network.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">Throughout the summer, I was able to work with business analysts and product owners to best understand the requirements and use-cases of my project.
                    I was also able to connect with the vendor service representatives and work directly with them to resolve any development issues.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">My work optimized business value by providing real-time access to vendor services to internal teams, improving the accuracy of data, and eliminating the need for manual reconciliation of data discrepancies.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">Having done my first industry internship entirely virtually in an extrememly uncertain time, I had to navigate unique circumstances and a completely new work environment.
                    The internship was shortened to only six weeks, changing the requirements of my project and leading to changed plans and crunched timelines.
                    Overall, I found that flexibility is one of the most important qualities to have to succeed in my career.

                  <p class="card-text">Here, I found a great foundation for my development and NLP knowledge as I was exposed to many different technologies and was given ample amount of freedom in my work.
                    In my first project, I contributed to <a href="https://github.com/lil-lab/cerealbar">Cereal Bar</a>, a game environment used to collect natural language data about collaborative interactions. It was built using Unity, C#, JavaScript, and Python.
                    I enhanced the system by creating a feedback mechanism, so that the guiding user could provide real-time feedback to the following user they are collaborating with.
                    To further extend the use of the game environment, we wanted to develop an add-on to be used for second language acquisition. I expanded the game to include a translation option using the Google Translate API.
                    I also prepared it for a study to see how well it could be used as a second language acquisition tool. This included updating the deployment mechanism to allow participants to be manually paired, rather than randomly, and updating the server, database, and reporting html files to gather and record feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">In my second project, I worked with a partner to begin a potential study from scratch. We analyzed the <a href="https://github.com/lil-lab/newsroom">Newsroom dataset</a> of 1.3 million news articles and human-written summaries to create a subset of news articles paired with multiple reference summaries each with different properties.
                    I investigated data first-hand by manually annotating a small subset of data to see if it was viable to cluster data based on event, and then find a diverse set of summaries for a single event. After proving viability, I clustered data using DBSCAN with TF-IDF score as the clustering metric to identify news articles reporting on the same event. Simply clustering data by event was rather difficult, as similar events like soccer matches at different tournaments were clustered together, unwantedly, as well as other nuanced problems. We tested various different methods and alterations to our algorithm to address these.
                    I also created a simple web application using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Flask and Python to display and easily interact with the clustered data.
                    This project would address an unsolved problem in (then current) NLP. There are models out there that are able to summarize articles, but none that can successfully produce summaries with specific writing styles. By curating this dataset of articles paired with multiple diverse human-written summaries, models could be trained to summarize with particular levels of extractiveness or abstractiveness.
                  <p class="card-text">During my experience here, I was able to successfully navigate my first projects outside of a class environment. The learning curve was steep– navigating a codebase and Git for the first time, learning NLP concepts, using Python libraries– but it was one of my most rewarding experiences. I felt empowered to work on complex projects and supported to dive into unexplored territory. As a computer science student with only two classes of computer science under my belt and no experience coding outside of class, dropped into an unfamiliar environment, I gained resilience and confidence.
